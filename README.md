<h1> Meet The Team </h1>

<strong>    Sean German <jsgerman@me.com> </strong>  
              Computer Science Major @ CSUChico, Chose this project as it allows me an opportunity to learn angular.js as well as work on a project that will be pushed to a production setting that it will be actually used.

<strong>     Lukas Fink <lfink579@googlemail.com> </strong><br />
                International student from Germany. Major: Media Technologie with focus on Media Informatics. Enrolled to Software Engineering to get to know workflows and programming skills from the US as well as improving my own skills. 5th Semester in Germany.

<strong>     Martin Mojica <mgteam.martin@gmail.com> </strong><br />
		I'm a computer science major interested in security. I enjoy learning new programming languages and tools. I hope to improve my knowledge and skills as the semester continues. Hope I can be of some help to my team.

<strong>    Francisco Tadillo <franciscotadillo@gmail.com> </strong><br />
            Computer Science major at California State University, Chico. I was debating whether going my own route or choosing a project that's already being worked on, but I ended up choosing this because of the cred we will earn from this project. From a professional stand-point, this seemed like the best choice. I'm excited to work hard with my team and learn the ins and outs of javascript. Looking forward to designing some functional and elegant-looking widgets.
